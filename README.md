# age-calculator

The Solar Age Calculator is a project designed to calculate a person's age on various planets in our solar system.
The Solar Age Calculator class takes an input of the person's age on Earth and provides methods to calculate their age on other planets. It includes the following methods:

getYearsPassed(pastBirthdayAge): This method calculates the number of years passed since a past birthday on each planet. It returns an object with the years passed on each planet.

getYearsRemaining(futureBirthdayAge): This method calculates the number of years yet to pass until a future birthday on each planet. It returns an object with the years remaining on each planet.
